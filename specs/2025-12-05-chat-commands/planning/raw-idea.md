# Raw Idea

Add a feature of 'chat commands' that we may toggle/activate with the `/` (forward slash). The first command to implement is model switch. This should be interactive with the list of available models from the GitHub Copilot API. Should have an autocomplete-like dropdown containing the list to TAB complete or something else if possible.
